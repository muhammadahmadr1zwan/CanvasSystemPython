# Mock Canvas System

## Overview

This project is a mock implementation of a Canvas-like educational management system. It allows users to perform tasks such as creating courses, uploading assignments, submitting assignments, grading, and viewing grades. This system is designed as a simulation of the core functionalities of an educational platform.

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Supports different user roles such as **students** and **instructors**.
  - Role-based access to various features and functionalities.
  
- **Course Management**:
  - Instructors can create and manage courses.
  - Courses can be assigned with unique course IDs.
  
- **Assignment Management**:
  - Instructors can upload assignments for students.
  - Students can submit assignments.
  - Instructors can grade submitted assignments.
  
- **Gradebook**:
  - Students can view their grades.
  - Instructors can manage grades and provide feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to develop this mock system.
- **SQLite** (optional): Can be used for a lightweight database solution for managing course data, assignments, and grades.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mock-canvas-system.git
    ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies** (if any):
   - If you are using SQLite or any third-party libraries, mention installation instructions here.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Use the command below to start the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Instructors

1. **Create a Course**:
   - Instructors can create new courses by providing a course name and ID.
   
2. **Upload Assignments**:
   - Instructors can add assignments by specifying the course, assignment name, and due date.
   
3. **Grade Submissions**:
   - After students submit assignments, instructors can view the submissions and assign grades.
   
4. **View Gradebook**:
   - Instructors can manage the gradebook for the course and view students' overall performance.

### Students

1. **Enroll in Courses**:
   - Students can enroll in available courses by providing the course ID.
   
2. **Submit Assignments**:
   - Students can upload their completed assignments for grading.
   
3. **View Grades**:
   - Students can view grades and feedback for submitted assignments.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application.
- **models.py**: Contains the user, course, and assignment classes.
- **views.py**: Manages the interaction between the user and the system.
- **database.py**: Handles storage (if using SQLite or other storage methods).

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement authentication for users to log in securely.
- **Notifications**: Add a feature for students to receive notifications for new assignments or grades.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a more interactive interface instead of the current command-line interface.
